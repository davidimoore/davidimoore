Stand up for the stupid and crazy,    
Devote your income and labor to others,  
Hate tyrants, argue not concerning God,  
Have patience and indulgence toward the people.  

Take off your hat to nothing known or unknown,  
or to any man or number of men,  
Go freely with powerful uneducated persons,  
And with the young, and with the mothers or families.  

Re-examine all you have been told. 
in school or church or in any book,  
Dismiss whatever insults your own soul;  
And your very flesh shall be a great poemâ€¦. 

And have the richest fluency, not only in its words,  
But in the silent lines of its lips and face,  
And between the lashes of your eyes,  
and In every motion and joint of your body.
